# Site Reliability Engineering

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is what you get when you treat operations as if it’s a software problem.

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) 
- combines software and systems engineering to build and run large-scale, massively distributed, fault-tolerant systems. 
- ensures that Google Cloud's services—both our internally critical and our externally-visible systems—have reliability, uptime appropriate to customer's needs and a fast rate of improvement. 
- Additionally SRE’s will keep an ever-watchful eye on our systems capacity and performance.
